# Installation
First, install the requirements, the `requirements.txt` file is just an output of `pip freeze` from my test venv 'k.<br>
Second, check `config.py` and set required values (api key, device index).<br>
Next, run the `main.py` script and Voil√†, as simple as that.<br><br>

And don't forget to put models of Vosk to main folder.<br>
You can get the latest from the [official website.](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models)
<br>The one I was using is `small`.

# Python version
I was using Python `3.8.3`, but it should work on any newer version.
